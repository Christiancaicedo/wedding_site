# Wedding Website

This is the website that I built for my fiance (soon to be wife) for our upcoming wedding in 2024.

This website will be used for guests to visit, learn more about us, our life as well as what to expect for the wedding.
We provide detailed information on travel, what to do while in town and wedding venue information.

For this website I built the entire RSVP backend system where guests can search their name, find themselves and RSVP for the wedding.
